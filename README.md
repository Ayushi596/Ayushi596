# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayushi! 🚀

I am an **AI Student** with an **8.93 CGPA**. I love taking the power of Artificial Intelligence and applying it to real-world engineering—like 3D modeling and physics simulations!

---

### 🌟 About Me
I enjoy building tools that make life easier for engineers and creators. I’m currently focused on **Interdisciplinary AI**, which is a fancy way of saying I like making different fields (like Physics/Biology and Code) talk to each other.

Whether it's automating a complex simulation or learning a new ML framework, I'm always looking for ways to use data to solve practical problems.

### 🧠 What I’m Curious About
* **Physics & AI:** Learning how to teach computers to understand the rules of the physical world.
* **Automation:** Building Python tools to handle the "boring" stuff so we can focus on being creative.
* **Deep Learning:** Exploring how Neural Networks can help us see and understand data in new ways.

---

### 🛠️ My Toolbox
* **Programming:** Python (my favorite!), C++, and SQL.
* **Special Tools:** Blender API (for 3D work), OpenFOAM (for simulations), and Git/GitHub.
* **AI Topics:** Neural Networks, Computer Vision, and Physics-Informed ML.

### 🎯 My Goal
I’m working toward a career where I can bridge the gap between **innovative tech companies** and **research organizations (like ISRO or IITs)**. I love learning, building, and sharing my journey along the way!
